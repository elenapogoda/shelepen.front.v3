      I worked in the distributed team from home as a support developer.
      I worked with few projects at once. These projects were big portals based on Drupal 7 and Drupal 8.
      Team and project management processes were implemented properly. Also I got a Drupal 7 project for redesigning.
      I worked as a back-end developer. Here we used a lot of different techniques of project development.
      At first it was hard then it became easier. I felt as an item of a big system.
      Everything became predictable with strict risks.
      I’ve got good and wide experience of working in the team and knowledge of management(team, project, code, ...) here.

      I had been working as a Drupal developer for 5 monthes.
      The development process looked as a factory.
      Everybody had their own responsibilities.
      We used Drupal 6 and the best practices, that company had for this time.
      I was a developer in the team, that supported “Johnson&Johnson” projects.
      It was a good example of corporate products, many small projectes related with each other
      and based on common platform (Drupal multisiting, Aegir, another common performance technologies).
      I received the huge experience how to work in a team with separate responsibilities, control results.
